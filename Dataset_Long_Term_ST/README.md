# Long Term ST Database

## Description of Dataset
86 lengthy ECG recordings of 80 human subjects, chosen to exhibit a variety of events of ST segment changes, including ischemic ST episodes, axis-related non-ischemic ST episodes, episodes of slow ST level drift, and episodes containing mixtures of these phenomena.

The individual recordings of the Long-Term ST Database are between 21 and 24 hours in duration, and contain two or three ECG signals. Each ECG signal has been digitized at 250 samples per second with 12-bit resolution over a range of ±10 millivolts. Each record includes a set of meticulously verified ST episode and signal quality annotations, together with additional beat-by-beat QRS annotations and ST level measurements.
