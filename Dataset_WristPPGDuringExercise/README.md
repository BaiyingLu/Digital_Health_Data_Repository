# Wrist PPG During Exercise

## Description of Dataset
This dataset was collected and was fully described in the following paper: [Description of a Database Containing Wrist PPG Signals Recorded during Physical Exercise with Both Accelerometer and Gyroscope Measures of Motion](https://www.mdpi.com/2306-5729/2/1/1).This database contains wrist PPGs recorded during walking, running and bike riding. Simultaneous motion estimates are collected using both accelerometers and gyroscopes to give multiple options for the removal of motion interference from the PPG traces. A reference chest ECG is included to allow a gold-standard comparison of heart rate during exercise.
