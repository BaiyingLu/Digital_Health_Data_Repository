# MIT-BIH Noise Stress Test Database

## Description of Dataset
12 half-hour ECG recordings & 3 half-hour recordings of noise typical in ambulatory ECG recordings. Recordings made on physically active volunteers and standard ECG recorders, leads, and electrodes (placed on limbs in positions in which the subjects' ECGs were not visible).
