# PPG-DaLiA Data Set

## Description of Dataset
This dataset was collected and was fully described in the following paper: [Deep PPG: Large-Scale Heart Rate Estimation with Convolutional Neural Networks](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/19/14/3079).PPG-DaLiA is a publicly available dataset for PPG-based heart rate estimation. This multimodal dataset features physiological and motion data, recorded from both a wrist- and a chest-worn device, of 15 subjects while performing a wide range of activities under close to real-life conditions. The included ECG data provides heart rate ground truth. The included PPG- and 3D-accelerometer data can be used for heart rate estimation, while compensating for motion artefacts.
