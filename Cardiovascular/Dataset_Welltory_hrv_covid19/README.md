# Welltory HRV COVID19 Dataset

## Description of Dataset
Welltory launched an open research project aimed at identifying diagnostic patterns of coronavirus-inflicted disease detection, progression, and recovery. People with the virus are invited to participate in this study by tracking their symptoms, heart rate variability, and data from wearables such as Apple Watch, Garmin, or Fitbit with the Welltory app. Welltory released this data to researchers who can study data patterns that may predict viral symptoms, and ultimately publish their findings.
