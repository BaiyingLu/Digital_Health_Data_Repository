# European ST-T Database

## Description of Dataset
This database consists of 90 annotated excerpts of ambulatory ECG recordings from 79 subjects. Myocardial ischemia was diagnosed or suspected for each subject. Additional selection criteria were established in order to obtain a representative selection of ECG abnormalities in the database, including baseline ST segment displacement resulting from conditions such as hypertension, ventricular dyskinesia, and effects of medication. 

The database includes 367 episodes of ST segment change, and 401 episodes of T-wave change, with durations ranging from 30 seconds to several minutes, and peak displacements ranging from 100 microvolts to more than one millivolt.

Each record is two hours in duration and contains two signals, each sampled at 250 samples per second with 12-bit resolution over a nominal 20 millivolt input range.
