# Pattern Analysis of Oxygen Saturation Variability

## Description of Dataset
This dataset was collected as part of the following study: [Pattern Analysis of Oxygen Saturation Variability in Healthy Individuals: Entropy of Pulse Oximetry Signals Carries Information about Mean Oxygen Saturation](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphys.2017.00555/full).This database contains one-hour oxygen saturation measurements of 36 patients, used for the analysis of oxygen saturation variability. The sampling frequency (SF) used to be 1kHz, but through preprocessing, the SF of the saved data is 1Hz.
