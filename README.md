# Digital Health Data Repository (DHDR)

The DHDR (Digital Health Data Repository) is a repository with sample data for use with the DBDP. 

We welcome contributions to the DHDR! If your data is too large to upload here, please consider linking a repo here to another data repository (PhysioNet, UCI ML) while we are working on getting the full DHDR up and running!

## Cardiovascular
| Dataset | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| [STEP](https://github.com/DigitalBiomarkerDiscoveryPipeline/Digital_Health_Data_Repository/tree/main/Dataset_STEP) | This dataset contains time-synced data from 6 wearable sensors and ECG over 4 activities with skin tone recorded  |

### Electrocardiogram (ECG)
| Dataset | Description |
| ------ | ------ | 
|[MHEALTH](https://github.com/DigitalBiomarkerDiscoveryPipeline/Digital_Health_Data_Repository/tree/main/Dataset_MHEALTH)| Body motion and vital signs recordings for ten volunteers while performing several physical activities. Includes acceleration, rate of turn and magnetic field orientation data as measured at various body positions, and 2-lead ECG measurements. 
| [ANSI/AAMI EC13 Test Waveforms](https://github.com/DigitalBiomarkerDiscoveryPipeline/Digital_Health_Data_Repository/tree/main/Dataset_ANSI_AAMI_EC13_Test_Waveforms) | Synthetic and real waveform recordings that can be used for testing a variety of devices that monitor the electrocardiogram. | 
[European ST-T Database](https://github.com/DigitalBiomarkerDiscoveryPipeline/Digital_Health_Data_Repository/tree/main/Dataset_European_ST_T) | The European ST-T Database is intended to be used for evaluation of algorithms for analysis of ST and T-wave changes. This database consists of 90 annotated excerpts of ambulatory ECG recordings from 79 subjects.|
[Long Term ST Database](https://github.com/DigitalBiomarkerDiscoveryPipeline/Digital_Health_Data_Repository/tree/main/Dataset_Long_Term_ST) | 86 lengthy ECG recordings of 80 human subjects, chosen to exhibit a variety of events of ST segment changes, including ischemic ST episodes, axis-related non-ischemic ST episodes, episodes of slow ST level drift, and episodes containing mixtures of these phenomena. |
[MIT-BIH Arrythmia Database](https://github.com/DigitalBiomarkerDiscoveryPipeline/Digital_Health_Data_Repository/tree/main/Dataset_MIT_BIH_Arrhythmia) | 48 half-hour excerpts of two-channel ambulatory ECG recordings, obtained from 47 subjects.

### Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM)
| Dataset | Description |
| ------ | ------ | 
|[REPLACE-BG](https://github.com/DigitalBiomarkerDiscoveryPipeline/Digital_Health_Data_Repository/tree/main/Dataset_REPLACE-BG)|Data from a 26-week randomized clinical trial of participants who have had T1D for at least one year.
|[JCHR Diabetes](https://github.com/DigitalBiomarkerDiscoveryPipeline/Digital_Health_Data_Repository/tree/main/Dataset_Jaeb-Diabetes)|Diabetes-related datasets and their corresponding protocol from 2010 to 2020. *(Refer to T1D Exchange below for past protocol. Newly added datasets include ReCGM, CITY, WISDM, SENCE, and JDRF.)*
|[T1D Exchange](https://github.com/DigitalBiomarkerDiscoveryPipeline/Digital_Health_Data_Repository/tree/main/Datasets_T1D-Exchange)|Type 1 diabetes datasets available for download from 11 studies ranging from 2010 to 2017. *(Note: Some protocol may be outdated. Refer to JCHR Database above for updated information.)*

## Activity
