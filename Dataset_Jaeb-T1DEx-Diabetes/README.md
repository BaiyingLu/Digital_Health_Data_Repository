# JCHR + T1D Exchange Diabetes Datasets and Documents

## Dataset 
The datasets and documentation are available for download through [The Jaeb Center for Health Research (JCHR)](https://public.jaeb.org/datasets/diabetes).

## Description of Dataset
The JCHR provides diabetes-related datasets and their corresponding protocol from 2010 to 2020. 

These datasets are also provided by T1D Exchange. [T1D Exchange](https://t1dexchange.org) is "a non-profit organization focused on accelerating therapies and improving care for type 1 diabetes individuals." The T1D Exchange Registry is a research study and data platform for individuals with type 1 diabetes.

## Analyzing this Dataset
[cgmquantify](https://github.com/DigitalBiomarkerDiscoveryPipeline/cgmquantify) is a Python package provided by the DBDP for
analyzing glucose and glucose variability. The package is also [available in R](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/cgmquantify/index.html).

## Previous Studies utilizing Dataset
These datasets have previously been used to
- examine racial differences in CGM measurements in relation to HbA1c
- establish reference sensor glucose ranges in healthy individuals without diabetes
- assess [CGM interventions in young adults with T1D](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2767160)
-  evaluate whether initiating CGM remotely can be performed safely and effectively (with the Dexcom G6 and Abbott FreeStyle Libre CGM systems)  

Details on these studies and more can be found in this [table](https://public.jaeb.org/datasets/diabetes).
