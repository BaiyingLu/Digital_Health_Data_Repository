## Previous Studies utilizing Dataset

These datasets have previously been used by the CITY study group to assess [CGM interventions in young adults with T1D](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2767160). Another pilot study uses the Dexcom G6 and Abbott FreeStyle Libre CGM systems to assess whether initiating CGM remotely can be performed safely and effectively. Details on these studies and more can be found in this [table](https://public.jaeb.org/datasets/diabetes).
